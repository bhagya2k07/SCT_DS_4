# 🚗 US Accidents Analysis (2016–2023)

This project is part of my **Data Science Internship at SkillCraft Technology** and completes **Task 4**. It focuses on analyzing real-world road accident data across the United States to identify patterns and contributing factors.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Analyze traffic accident patterns based on:
  - 🕒 Time of day
  - 🌧️ Weather conditions
  - 🛣️ Road features
- Visualize accident **hotspots** and **contributing conditions**

---

## 📂 Dataset

**Source**: [US Accidents (2016 - 2023)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents/data)  
- Contains over 7.9 million accident records from across the US.

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Time of Day**: Most accidents happen during peak commute hours (7–9 AM and 4–6 PM).
- **Day of Week**: Accidents are more frequent on weekdays, especially Friday.
- **Weather Conditions**: Accidents are common during clear, rainy, or overcast weather.
- **Road Features**: Crossings, junctions, and traffic signals see higher accident counts.
- **Hotspots**: Accident density is highest in urban states like California, Texas, and Florida.

## 📊 Visualizations

- 📈 Accidents by Hour and Day of Week
- 🌦️ Top 10 Weather Conditions Leading to Accidents
- 🚧 Accidents by Road Feature (Crossing, Traffic Signal, etc.)
- 🗺️ **Heatmap of Accident Hotspots** using Folium

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Folium (for interactive map visualization)
- Google Colab
